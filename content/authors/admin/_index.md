Alparslan Erol is a MSc. Student in Computer Science at PJAIT currently and had his undergraduate degree in Boğaziçi University, studying Electrical&Electronics Engineering. 

His academic interests are based on AI systems with using optimization techniques, computer science and data science related topics such as classification and regression modeling by using machine learning and deep learning. He has chosen these topics because, there is heavy theorical information at background which is supported by statistics, machine learning and data mining and there is an implementation chance via coding. Implementation is an important side of theory which will let him create products and serve to the market to improve socioeconomic factors for humanity. To achieve his academic goals, he needs to understand complex theorems and systems to simplify daily life, economy/financial tasks. These topics are a way for him to both understand theorems and simplify life via researching literature and adding on science via expressing himself with his code, outputs, synthesis, and analysis.

He is continuously trying to develop himself with an aim to understand data science deeper. For that reason, he is following courses from DataCamp and expanding his knowledge of data science. He loves learning new things about this topic via Medium, Stackoverflow and much more. He is a skilled programmer with Python, C++, C, Java, SQL, and you can check his coding skills, achievements, experiences and projects about data science through the links below.

He has completed one semester at MSc. Computer Science, Polish Japanese Academy of Information Technology. In this semester, He got Relational Databases (SQL), Operating Systems (Linux), Object Oriented Programming and GUI (Java), Information System Design (UML Design), Foundations of Computer Simulations (Python) courses for master’s degree education. With this semester, he compensated missing courses to be a better Computer Scientist and skilled Data Scientist.

He got his BSc. (Engineering) Degree at Boğazici University Electrical & Electronics Engineering program in January 2020, Istanbul. In BSc. Degree junior year, he got Control Systems lecture, he chose control option as a specialization area at his senior year then he got some related courses such as Linear Systems Theory, Control Technologies and Design, Robotics and Optimization Theory.

He is highly motivated to have an academic career in data science/computer science related topics. He got this passion from related courses above that he has taken in his university. Besides these courses, he also started to work on these subjects during his school project team works, internships and professional working experiences.

While he was “Machine Learning Project Intern” at Bosch Turkey, he had a project titled as “AI Based Production Line Know-How Generator”. To succeed this project, he collaborated with different stakeholders from different departments and created a data lake. After cleaning and fixing data lake, he applied different machine learning models. Algorithm selected is based on an ensemble method which is Light Gradient Boosting Method (LGBM).

During his Mercedes-Benz working experience as a part time software developer, he analyzed big-data which is collected from Mercedes-Benz trucks every day. With a collaborative teamwork in R&D Center, he applied machine learning algorithms on big-data to create meaningful outputs. Generating "Artificial Test Data" with using a time series deep learning method LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) was his one of the successfully completed task.
