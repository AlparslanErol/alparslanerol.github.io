[{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"Alparslan Erol is a MSc. Student in Computer Science at PJAIT currently and had his undergraduate degree in Boğaziçi University, studying Electrical\u0026amp;Electronics Engineering.\nHis academic interests are based on AI systems with using optimization techniques, computer science and data science related topics such as classification and regression modeling by using machine learning and deep learning. He has chosen these topics because, there is heavy theorical information at background which is supported by statistics, machine learning and data mining and there is an implementation chance via coding. Implementation is an important side of theory which will let him create products and serve to the market to improve socioeconomic factors for humanity. To achieve his academic goals, he needs to understand complex theorems and systems to simplify daily life, economy/financial tasks. These topics are a way for him to both understand theorems and simplify life via researching literature and adding on science via expressing himself with his code, outputs, synthesis, and analysis.\nHe is continuously trying to develop himself with an aim to understand data science deeper. For that reason, he is following courses from DataCamp and expanding his knowledge of data science. He loves learning new things about this topic via Medium, Stackoverflow and much more. He is a skilled programmer with Python, C++, C, Java, SQL, and you can check his coding skills, achievements, experiences and projects about data science through the links below.\nHe has completed one semester at MSc. Computer Science, Polish Japanese Academy of Information Technology. In this semester, He got Relational Databases (SQL), Operating Systems (Linux), Object Oriented Programming and GUI (Java), Information System Design (UML Design), Foundations of Computer Simulations (Python) courses for master’s degree education. With this semester, he compensated missing courses to be a better Computer Scientist and skilled Data Scientist.\nHe got his BSc. (Engineering) Degree at Boğazici University Electrical \u0026amp; Electronics Engineering program in January 2020, Istanbul. In BSc. Degree junior year, he got Control Systems lecture, he chose control option as a specialization area at his senior year then he got some related courses such as Linear Systems Theory, Control Technologies and Design, Robotics and Optimization Theory.\nHe is highly motivated to have an academic career in data science/computer science related topics. He got this passion from related courses above that he has taken in his university. Besides these courses, he also started to work on these subjects during his school project team works, internships and professional working experiences.\nWhile he was “Machine Learning Project Intern” at Bosch Turkey, he had a project titled as “AI Based Production Line Know-How Generator”. To succeed this project, he collaborated with different stakeholders from different departments and created a data lake. After cleaning and fixing data lake, he applied different machine learning models. Algorithm selected is based on an ensemble method which is Light Gradient Boosting Method (LGBM).\nDuring his Mercedes-Benz working experience as a part time software developer, he analyzed big-data which is collected from Mercedes-Benz trucks every day. With a collaborative teamwork in R\u0026amp;D Center, he applied machine learning algorithms on big-data to create meaningful outputs. Generating \u0026ldquo;Artificial Test Data\u0026rdquo; with using a time series deep learning method LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) was his one of the successfully completed task.\n","date":1441065600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1441065600,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/author/alparslan-erol/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/alparslan-erol/","section":"authors","summary":"Alparslan Erol is a MSc.

The three big and common schemes borrowed from the machine-learning community in recent academic research are neural networks, support vector machines (SVM) and decision-making trees or forests with boosting and ensemble methods.\nIn this paper, some machine learning and deep dearning algorithms such supervised learning as gaussian naive bayes (GNB), decision-making trees (DT), ada boost classifier (ABC), random forest (RF), light gradient boosting (LGB) and such unsupervised deep learning method as Auto-Encoder (AE) are implemented with a uniform environment and the purpose of exploring the practice and issues of using these approaches in detecting anomaly behaviors. After data preprocessing and feature selection part some manipulation are implemented to the dataset. GNB, DT, ABC, RF and LGB are implemented and found that LGB has the best performance. Then deep dive into LGB model and used binary and multiclass classisficaiton methods with parameter tuning. Because of balance importance cross entropy and for data unbalancy between normal and attack type variables, focal loss is used to down-weight for normal type data and get the best solutions. Also an unsupervised learning (AE) added to the list and all this algorithms are compared.\nThe experiments were conducted on the intrusion detection dataset called KDD’99 cup dataset. After exploratory data analysis, it is found that, 1 feature has no impact on target, 3 feature have highly correlated with each other, ~78% of initial data are duplicated and some features are not important for target when they are compared with the important features.\nThe comparison of the different machine learning model results with and without dimensionality reduction is also done.\nConclusion The main purpose of this project is to developed machine learning models that can detect different anomaly attack types. Some machine learning and deep dearning algorithms such supervised learning as gaussian naive bayes (GNB), decision-making trees (DT), ada boost classifier (ABC), random forest (RF), light gradient boosting (LGB) and such unsupervised deep learning method as Auto-Encoder (AE) are implemented with a uniform environment and the purpose of exploring the practice and issues of using these approaches in detecting anomaly behaviors. After data preprocessing and feature selection part some manipulation are implemented to the dataset. GNB, DT, ABC, RF and LGB are implemented and found that LGB has the best performance. Then deep dive into LGB model and used binary and multiclass classisficaiton methods with parameter tuning. Because of balance importance cross entropy and for data unbalancy between normal and attack type variables, focal loss is used to down-weight for normal type data and get the best solutions. Also an unsupervised learning (AE) added to the list and all this algorithms are compared and all results are given above.\nFor future project, after precise feature extraction to BOUN (Boğaziçi University) network attack dataset, light gradient boosting model with focal loss and parameter optimization can use for supervised learning or auto-encoder can be used for unsupervised learning.\nBibliography [1]\tT.

In spite of its high density, lead is toxic and lead aprons are very heavy for personal shielding. Thus, there is a need for nontoxic, light, and environmental friendly radiation-shielding materials. Polymers cannot be effective against gamma radiation on their own. High-density metal wolfram carbide could be useful against gamma radiation, and boron carbide could also be useful for neutron shielding. In this study, high-density polyethylene, boron carbide, and wolfram carbide can be mixed in certain amounts and composite discs can be obtained in this way. According to results, a new shielding material is efficient for gamma radiation.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Radiation shielding of polymer composite materials with wolfram carbide and boron carbide","type":"publication"}]
